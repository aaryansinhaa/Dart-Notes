Loops in Dart are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. Dart supports several types of loops, including `for`, `while`, and `do-while`. Here's an overview of each:

### 1. `for` Loop:

The `for` loop is used when you know the number of iterations in advance. It has three parts: initialization, condition, and iteration expression.

```dart
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  print('Iteration $i');
}
//i++ = i+1
//i-- = i-1
```

- **Initialization (`int i = 0`):** Executes once at the beginning to initialize the loop variable.
- **Condition (`i < 5`):** Checked before each iteration. If false, the loop exits.
- **Iteration Expression (`i++`):** Executed after each iteration.

### 2. `while` Loop:

The `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance. It continues as long as the specified condition is true.

```dart
int i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
  print('Iteration $i');
  i++;
}
```

- **Condition (`i < 5`):** Checked before each iteration. If false, the loop exits.

### 3. `do-while` Loop:

Similar to the `while` loop, but the condition is checked after the block of code has been executed. This guarantees that the block of code is executed at least once.

```dart
int i = 0;

do {
  print('Iteration $i');
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

- **Condition (`i < 5`):** Checked after each iteration. If false, the loop exits.

### Loop Control Statements:

Dart also provides loop control statements to modify the flow of a loop:

- **`break`:** Exits the innermost loop or switch statement.
- **`continue`:** Skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.

```dart
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i == 2) {
    continue; // Skips iteration when i is 2
  }
  if (i == 4) {
    break; // Exits the loop when i is 4
  }
  print('Iteration $i');
}
```

### Iterating Collections:

Dart also provides a concise way to iterate over collections using the `for-in` loop:

```dart
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (int number in numbers) {
  print('Number: $number');
}
// a variable "number" of datatype int is made and it is iterated on list numbers.
```

This loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` list.

Understanding and using loops efficiently is essential for writing dynamic and flexible Dart programs.
