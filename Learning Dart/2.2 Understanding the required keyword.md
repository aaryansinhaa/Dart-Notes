In Dart, the `required` keyword is used in constructor parameter declarations to indicate that a parameter must be provided when creating an instance of the class. When a parameter is marked as `required`, it means that the corresponding argument must be passed during object initialization, and it cannot be omitted.

Here's an example:

```dart
class Person {
  String name;
  int age;

  Person({required this.name, required this.age});
}

void main() {
  // Creating an instance of Person
  var person = Person(name: 'John', age: 30);

  print('Name: ${person.name}, Age: ${person.age}');
}
```

In this example:

- The `Person` class has a constructor with two parameters: `name` and `age`.
- Both parameters are marked as `required` using the `required` keyword.
- When creating an instance of the `Person` class, the values for both `name` and `age` must be provided.

If you try to create an instance of `Person` without providing values for the required parameters, Dart will raise a compile-time error:

```dart
var person = Person(); // Compilation error: Missing required parameters: name, age
```

By using the `required` keyword, you explicitly communicate to developers using your class that certain parameters are mandatory, helping to ensure that instances are properly initialized with the necessary data. This can lead to more robust and less error-prone code by catching potential issues at compile time rather than runtime.

*note: We cannot have any more positional arguments after required arguments*
