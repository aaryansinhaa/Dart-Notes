The `abstract` keyword in Dart is used to define abstract classes and abstract methods. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly; instead, it serves as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract methods within an abstract class are declared but do not provide an implementation in the abstract class itself. Subclasses that extend the abstract class must provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods.

### Abstract Class:

1. **Abstract Class Definition:**
   - An abstract class is declared using the `abstract` keyword.
   - It can include both normal (concrete) methods and abstract methods.
   - Objects cannot be created directly from an abstract class.

```dart
abstract class Shape {
  void draw(); // Abstract method
  void resize(int percentage) {
    print('Resizing by $percentage%'); // Concrete method
  }
}
```

In this example, `Shape` is an abstract class with an abstract method `draw` and a concrete method `resize`.

2. **Subclassing an Abstract Class:**
   - Subclasses that extend an abstract class must provide concrete implementations for all abstract methods.

```dart
class Circle extends Shape {
  @override
  void draw() {
    print('Drawing a circle');
  }
}
```

In this example, `Circle` is a subclass of `Shape` and provides a concrete implementation for the abstract method `draw`.

3. **Creating Objects:**
   - Objects are created from the concrete subclasses, not the abstract class itself.

```dart
void main() {
  var myCircle = Circle();
  myCircle.draw(); // Outputs 'Drawing a circle'
  myCircle.resize(50); // Outputs 'Resizing by 50%'
}
```

### Why Use Abstract Classes?

- **Common Interface:** Abstract classes provide a common interface for a group of related classes. Subclasses share the same set of methods but can have different implementations.

- **Enforce Structure:** Abstract classes can enforce a certain structure by declaring abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.

### Abstract Methods:

1. **Abstract Method Definition:**
   - An abstract method is declared without providing an implementation in the abstract class.
   - It ends with a semicolon (`;`) instead of a method body.

```dart
abstract class Animal {
  void makeSound(); // Abstract method
}
```

2. **Implementation in Subclass:**
   - Subclasses must provide concrete implementations for all abstract methods.

```dart
class Dog extends Animal {
  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print('Woof! Woof!');
  }
}
```

In this example, `Dog` is a subclass of `Animal` and provides a concrete implementation for the abstract method `makeSound`.

### Benefits of Abstract Classes and Methods:

- **Code Structure:** Abstract classes help organize code by defining a common structure for related classes.
  
- **Forcing Implementation:** Abstract methods ensure that subclasses provide specific functionality, enforcing a certain behavior.

In summary, the `abstract` keyword in Dart is used to create abstract classes and abstract methods. Abstract classes provide a common structure, and abstract methods declare a set of methods that must be implemented by subclasses. They play a key role in creating well-structured and extensible object-oriented code.

*note: 
`extends` keyword can only be used when we provide a concrete implementation of the method or else we will have to use the `@override` keyword to provide a concrete implementation.*
