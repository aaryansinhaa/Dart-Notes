The `override` keyword in Dart is used to explicitly indicate that a method in a subclass is intended to override a method with the same signature from its superclass. It is a way for the developer to declare that they are intentionally providing a new implementation for a method that already exists in the superclass.

Here's a breakdown of how and why the `override` keyword is used:

### 1. **Method Overriding:**

Inheritance allows a subclass to inherit properties and behaviors from its superclass. When a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass, it is said to "override" that method.

```dart
class Animal {
  void makeSound() {
    print('Some generic sound');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print('Woof! Woof!');
  }
}

void main() {
  Dog myDog = Dog();
  myDog.makeSound(); // Outputs 'Woof! Woof!'
}
```

In this example, `Dog` is a subclass of `Animal`, and it overrides the `makeSound` method with its own implementation.

### 2. **Using the `override` Keyword:**

While it's not strictly required to use the `override` keyword, it is considered good practice to include it. It serves as a signal to both the developer and the Dart compiler that the method is intended to override a method in the superclass.

```dart
class Cat extends Animal {
  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print('Meow!');
  }
}
```

In this case, `@override` is added before the `makeSound` method in the `Cat` class to indicate that it is intentionally overriding the method from the `Animal` class.

### 3. **Benefits of Using `override`:**

- **Intent Clarity:** Including `@override` makes the code more readable and makes it clear to other developers (and tools) that the method is intended to override a superclass method.

- **Compiler Checks:** The Dart compiler can perform additional checks to ensure that the method in the subclass actually overrides a method in the superclass. This can help catch potential errors.

### Important Notes:

- If you use the `override` keyword and the method doesn't actually override a method in the superclass, the Dart compiler will generate an error.

- When overriding a method, the signature of the method in the subclass must match the signature of the method in the superclass, including the return type.

Using `override` is a good practice to enhance code readability and catch potential errors, making it clear that a method in a subclass is providing a specific implementation for a method in its superclass.
