In object-oriented programming, both classes and interfaces serve as blueprints, but they have different roles and purposes. Let's explore the key differences between classes and interfaces:

### 1. **Definition:**

- **Class:**
  - A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
  - It defines both the structure (attributes or fields) and behavior (methods) of objects.
  - Objects are instances of classes, and they can have their unique state and behavior.

- **Interface:**
  - An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods without providing their implementation.
  - It declares a set of methods that any class implementing the interface must provide.
  - Interfaces do not have their own state; they only define a structure for methods.

### 2. **Implementation:**

- **Class:**
  - A class provides a full implementation, including both the structure and behavior.
  - It can have fields, methods, constructors, and other members.
  - A class can be instantiated to create objects.

- **Interface:**
  - An interface provides method signatures but does not provide any implementation details.
  - It is up to the classes that implement the interface to provide the actual code for the methods.
  - Interfaces do not have constructors or fields; they focus solely on method declarations.

### 3. **Inheritance:**

- **Class:**
  - Classes support both single and multiple inheritance in some programming languages.
  - A class can inherit from another class, acquiring its properties and behaviors.

- **Interface:**
  - Interfaces support multiple inheritance, allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces.
  - A class can inherit the method contracts from multiple interfaces, even if it can only inherit from one class.

### 4. **Instantiation:**

- **Class:**
  - Objects are instances of classes.
  - You can create multiple objects from the same class, and each object has its state.

- **Interface:**
  - Interfaces themselves cannot be instantiated. They are meant to be implemented by classes.
  - Objects are instances of classes that implement the interface.

### 5. **Usage:**

- **Class:**
  - Classes are used for creating objects, encapsulating state, and defining behavior.
  - They represent concrete implementations of entities in your system.

- **Interface:**
  - Interfaces are used to define contracts and enforce a certain structure of methods that implementing classes must adhere to.
  - They provide a way to achieve abstraction and polymorphism in programming.

### Example:

```dart
// Class example
class Dog {
  String name;

  Dog(this.name);

  void bark() {
    print('$name is barking!');
  }
}

// Interface example
abstract class Animal {
  void makeSound();
}

class Cat implements Animal {
  String name;

  Cat(this.name);

  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print('$name is meowing!');
  }
}
```

In this example, `Dog` is a class with its own state and behavior, while `Animal` is an interface providing a method contract that `Cat` implements.

In summary, while both classes and interfaces are blueprints, classes provide concrete implementations with both structure and behavior, whereas interfaces define method contracts without implementation. Classes are used for creating objects, while interfaces are used to enforce a certain structure for methods that implementing classes must provide.
