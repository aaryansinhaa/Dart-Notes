In Dart, variables are used to store and manipulate data. Here are some key aspects of variables in Dart:

### 1. **Declaration and Initialization:**
   - Dart supports static typing, where you declare the type of a variable explicitly or use type inference. You can declare a variable using the `var` keyword or explicitly specify the type.

     ```dart
     // Type inference
     var name = 'John';

     // Explicit type declaration
     String greeting = 'Hello';
     ```

### 2. **Data Types:**
   - Dart has various data types, including:
     - `int`: Integer numbers
     - `double`: Double-precision floating-point numbers
     - `String`: Sequence of characters
     - `bool`: Boolean values (true/false)
     - `List`: Ordered collection
     - `Map`: Key-value pairs
     - `Set`: Unordered collection of unique values

     ```dart
     int age = 25;
     double height = 5.9;
     String message = 'Dart is awesome!';
     bool isStudent = true;
     List<String> fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
     ```

### 3. **Dynamic Typing:**
   - Dart also supports dynamic typing, where the type of a variable is determined at runtime. You can use the `dynamic` keyword for dynamic typing.

     ```dart
     dynamic dynamicVariable = 'This can be a string';
     dynamicVariable = 42; // Now it can be an integer
     ```

### 4. **Constants:**
   - Dart allows you to declare constants using the `final` or `const` keyword. `final` variables are evaluated at runtime, whereas `const` variables are evaluated at compile-time.

     ```dart
     final int a = 10; // Runtime constant
     const double pi = 3.14159; // Compile-time constant
     ```

### 5. **Scope:**
   - Variables have a scope, which is the region of code where the variable is accessible. Dart uses block-level scoping.

     ```dart
     void exampleFunction() {
       int x = 10; // Variable x is only accessible within this function
       print(x);
     }
     ```

### 6. **Null Safety:**
   - Dart has introduced null safety, which means that variables are non-nullable by default. If a variable can be null, you need to declare it explicitly with a `?` or use the `late` keyword.

     ```dart
     String? nullableString = 'Nullable';
     ```

### 7. **Initializing Variables:**
   - Variables can be initialized when declared or later in the code.

     ```dart
     String name = 'Alice'; // Initialized when declared
     int age;
     age = 30; // Initialized later
     ```

Understanding these concepts will help you effectively use variables in Dart for various programming tasks.


### 8.  **When to Use ${}:*
- Variables can be utilised for many functions in the code like:

```Dart

String someValue = "Greeting from Aaryan";
print("Hello, $someValue"); // returns Hello, Greeting from Aaryan
print("Hello, ${someValue.length}"); // returns Hello, 21
//${} is used when we have to perform some operations on the variable like we performed the operation of .length here.

```
