Conditional statements in Dart allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. Dart supports the standard set of conditional statements found in most programming languages. Here are the main ones:

### 1. `if` Statement:

The `if` statement allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.

```dart
int age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  print('You are an adult.');
} else {
  print('You are a minor.');
}
```

### 2. `else if` Statement:

You can use `else if` to check additional conditions if the initial `if` condition is false.

```dart
int age = 25;

if (age < 18) {
  print('You are a minor.');
} else if (age >= 18 && age < 65) {
  print('You are an adult.');
} else {
  print('You are a senior citizen.');
}
```

### 3. `switch` Statement:

The `switch` statement is used when you have a series of conditions and want to perform different actions based on the value of an expression.

```dart
String day = 'Monday';

switch (day) {
  case 'Monday':
    print('It\'s the start of the week.');
    break;
  case 'Friday':
    print('TGIF!');
    break;
  default:
    print('It\'s just another day.');
}
```

### 4. Conditional Expressions:

Dart also supports conditional expressions (`? :`) which provide a concise way to write simple if-else statements in a single line.

```dart
int x = 5;
String result = (x > 0) ? 'Positive' : 'Non-positive';
print(result);
```

### 5. `assert` Statement:

The `assert` statement is used for debugging. It evaluates a boolean expression and, in development mode, throws an error if the expression is false.

```dart
int value = 10;
assert(value >= 0, 'Value must be non-negative');
```

### 6. Null-aware Operators:

Dart also provides null-aware operators for concise expressions when dealing with nullable variables:

- `??`: If the expression on the left is non-null, it returns it; otherwise, it evaluates and returns the expression on the right.
  ```dart
  String name = null;
  String result = name ?? 'John';
  ```

- `?.`: Allows calling a method or accessing a property on an object only if the object is non-null.
  ```dart
  String? nullableName = getNullableName();
  int length = nullableName?.length ?? 0;
  ```

Understanding and using these conditional statements and operators will enable you to write more flexible and expressive Dart code.

### EXTRA: 

Generally, we never use relational operators in switch case but dart allows it:
The `when` keyword in Dart is used in combination with the `switch` statement to provide additional conditions for each `case`. It allows you to specify conditions that must be true for a particular case to be executed. Here's an example:

```dart
void main() {
  String fruit = 'apple';

  switch (fruit) {
    case 'banana':
      print('This is a banana.');
      break;
    case 'apple' when fruit.length > 5:
      print('This is a long apple.');
      break;
    case 'apple':
      print('This is a regular apple.');
      break;
    case 'orange':
      print('This is an orange.');
      break;
    default:
      print('Unknown fruit.');
  }
}
```

In this example:

- The `switch` statement is used to check the value of the `fruit` variable.
- The first `case` checks for the value 'banana' and prints a message.
- The second `case` uses the `when` keyword to add an additional condition (`fruit.length > 5`). It only executes if the value of `fruit` is 'apple' and the length of the string is greater than 5.
- The third `case` checks for the value 'apple' without any additional conditions.
- The fourth `case` checks for the value 'orange'.
- The `default` case is executed if none of the previous cases match.

When using the `when` keyword, the conditions specified after it are evaluated along with the equality check. If the conditions are true, the corresponding case block is executed.

This feature provides a more flexible way to handle cases based on additional conditions, making your code more expressive and readable.
